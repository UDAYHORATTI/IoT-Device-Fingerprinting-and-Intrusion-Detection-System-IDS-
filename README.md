# IoT-Device-Fingerprinting-and-Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-
The IoT Device Fingerprinting and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to identify and monitor IoT devices in a network by fingerprinting their unique characteristics (e.g., MAC addresses, device behavior, traffic patterns) and detecting any unusual or potentially malicious behavior.
